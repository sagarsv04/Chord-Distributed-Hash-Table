File :
============

1)	./gen-py/chord/\*.py         - Contains files used, generated by thrift
2)	./chord.thrift               - File used while generating above files by thrift
3)	./init                       - Py File to initialize nodes of servers
4)	./src/server.py              - Py File contains implementation of stubs methods generated by thrift
5)	./src/client.py              - Py File contains implementation to test the stubs methods on server
6)	./server.sh                  - Script to start all the servers based on argument <port> from list in "./nodes" file
7)	./client.sh                  - Script to test all the stubs methods on server based on arguments <operation type> <ip> <port> <file name> from list in "./operations" file


Run :
============

- Open a terminal in project directory
- Run all the servers at onces                    : ./server.sh -> then type the file name of nodes list
- Run all operation using client at onces         : ./client.sh -> then type the file name of operation list
- Run individual client operations                : python3 ./src/client.py <operation type> <ip> <port> <file name>
- Type python3 ./src/client.py -h to know more about the arguments expected


Note :
============

- Language & Framework  : Python 3.5.2 & Thrift version 0.13.0
- All the stubs methods are implemented and tested on the server side.
